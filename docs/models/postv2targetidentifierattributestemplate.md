# PostV2TargetIdentifierAttributesTemplate

For actor reference attributes, you may pass a dynamic value of `"current-user"`. When creating new records or entries, this will cause the actor reference value to be populated with either the workspace member or API token that created the record/entry.


## Values

| Name           | Value          |
